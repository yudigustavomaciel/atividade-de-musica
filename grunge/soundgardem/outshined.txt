I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now

I just looked in the mirror
Things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California
And feeling Minnesota

(So now you know)
Who gets mystified
(So now you know)
Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again

I'm feeling
I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Someone let the dogs out
They'll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shitting

I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking
I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking

(So now you know)
Who gets mystified
(So now you know)
Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again

I'm feeling
I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

(So now you know)
Who gets mystified
(So now you know)
Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again

I'm feeling
I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined
