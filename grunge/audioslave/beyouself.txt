While you've been coughing
I've been drinking life
While you've been nauseous
And so I drink to health
While you kill yourself
And I've got just one thing
That I can offer

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Yeah!

I'm not a martyr
I'm not a prophet
And I won't preach to you
But here's a caution
You better understand
That I won't hold your hand
But if it helps you mend
Then I won't stop it

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Yeah!

Drown if you want
And I'll see you at the bottom
Where you'll crawl on my skin
And put the blame on me
So you don't feel a thing

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Yeah!Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away

Someone gets excited in a chapel-yard
And catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave

Yeah
And to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey
To be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone
Another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself
Down inside himself he prays

Someone swears his true love
Until the end of time
Another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

And to be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do

And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of love
Don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
But to be yourself is all that you can do
Yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do

To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can do
