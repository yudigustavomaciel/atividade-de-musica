Breakin' my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breakin' my back just to know your name
But Heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes, but don't blink, you might miss

'Cause Heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, Heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Takin' its toll, then I'm leavin' without you

'Cause Heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, Heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around

Pace yourself for me (for me)
I said maybe, baby, please (please)
But I just don't know now (maybe, baby)
When all I wanna do is try

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around

Oh, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around

Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushin', a-rushin' around
