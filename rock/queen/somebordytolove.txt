Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Ooh

Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror) take a look in the mirror
And cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (somebody)
Ooh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard)
Everyday of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (yes, on my knees on)
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (somebody)
Ooh, somebody (please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard) everyday (everyday)
I try, and I try, and I try
But everybody wants to put me down, they say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah, I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ooh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love? (Anyone)
(Somebody find me someone to love) got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
